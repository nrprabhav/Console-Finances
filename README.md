## Description
The project is a coding practice for javascript. In this program, I analyze a 2D array of financial data which contains the month information along with how much profit/loss is made by the company. I analyze the data given to calculate parameters such as total profit, average change in profit, greatest increase in profits and greatest decrease in profits.
